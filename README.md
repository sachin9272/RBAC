# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Project

## Overview
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. RBAC is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. Users are assigned roles, and roles are granted permissions to perform specific actions on resources. This approach ensures fine-grained and scalable access management.

---

## Features
- User Management:
  - Create, update, and delete users.
  - Assign roles to users.
- Role Management:
  - Define and manage roles.
  - Assign permissions to roles.
- Resource Access Control:
  - Enforce access restrictions based on roles and permissions.
  - Log access attempts for auditing.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

---

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- MongoDB
### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rbac-project.git
   ```

2. Backend Setup:
   ```bash
   npm install

   # Update the .env file with your database credentials and JWT SECRET KEY
   npm run start
   ```

3. Access the backend API at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Usage
1. Use the API to:
   - Create roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).
   - Define permissions for resources (e.g., `/data`, `/settings`).
   - Assign roles to users.
   - Authenticate users and manage their access to resources.

---

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Authenticate user and return JWT token.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register`: Register a new user.

### User Management
- `GET /api/users`: List all users.
- `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
- `PATCH /api/users/{id}`: Update user details.
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}`: Delete a user.

### Role Management
- `GET /api/roles`: List all roles.
- `POST /api/roles`: Create a new role.
- `PATCH /api/roles/{id}`: Update role details.
- `DELETE /api/roles/{id}`: Delete a role.

---

## Testing
Run tests for backend:
```bash
npm test
```
